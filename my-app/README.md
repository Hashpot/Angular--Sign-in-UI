This is an angular application. To run this application simply enter `ng serve` for a development server once you have installed the node modules. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

From the very begginning after reading what I needed to do, this is what I assumed from the start 

I would first review the Sketch design to understand the layout, color scheme, typography, and other design elements. I would also take note of the measurements and units specified in the task.

Next, I would start planning my approach to the coding challenge. I would identify the key components of the design, such as the header, form elements, and footer. I would then break down each component into smaller pieces and plan how to code them using best practices for accessibility, maintainability, and scalability.

Before beginning to code, I would set up my development environment with the necessary tools, such as a text editor, browser, and any frameworks or libraries that may be needed. If I were creating an Angular application, I would install and configure the necessary dependencies and modules.

As I code, I would continuously test my work to ensure that it meets the design specifications and requirements for accessibility, brand awareness, and coding standards. I would also incorporate responsive design principles to ensure that the page looks and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.

Finally, once the coding challenge is complete, I would review my code to ensure that it is maintainable, scalable, and adheres to best practices for web development. I would also test the page on various browsers and devices to ensure that it functions correctly and looks consistent across different platforms.
